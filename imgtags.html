	<p><b>Random Paragraph. </b>This section of the document tests the paragraph function, in relation to the img tag. It is merely a test and nothing more. I am now just saying words for the sake of talking. Blah blah blah. Nothing that is said here will be in any way important to anyone. Ever. Why are you reading this? Go do something productive with your life!</p>
