    <p>Your developer, Joshua Kling, is a world-class wrestler and fighter of bears. He once led the Danish army to victory against the British. Accidentally. While he does occasionally imitate a photographic hobby, it's really just a cover for his clandestine actions for MI6. Yes, he does now work for the Brits. He's good at being a secret agent. Or triple agent. Or is he? Anyways, after he finishes up the unified theory of the universe, he will likely go back to finishing this site.</p>
